# Blitzit DnD â€“ Vue 3 + Electron + Vite + Tailwind + @dnd-kit/dom

This project is a **desktop application prototype** built with **Vue 3 + Electron**.  
It demonstrates **modern drag-and-drop functionality** with **virtualized task lists** using `@tanstack/vue-virtual` and `@dnd-kit/dom`.

The goal is to replace outdated Vue drag-and-drop solutions with a robust, production-ready setup for **Boards**, **Sections**, and a **Dashboard grid**, while also applying **positioning logic**, **animations**, and **intermediate confirmation actions**.
